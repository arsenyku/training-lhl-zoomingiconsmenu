# Lighthouse Labs: Zooming Icons Exercise

Exercise to create a custom transition between view controllers where tapping
on an icon will make that icon and its background expand to fill the screen.
The icon will end up zoomed and visible in the centre of the  final view 
controller that we are transitioning to.

Learning goals:
- use UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning for custom transitions
- reinforce use of view snapshots and affine transformations on views
- code in Swift
