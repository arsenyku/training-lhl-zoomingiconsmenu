# Lighthouse Labs: Zooming Icons Exercise

Exercise to create a custom transition between view controllers where tapping
on an icon will make that icon and its background expand to fill the screen.
The icon will end up zoomed and visible in its correct place in the final
view controller that we are transitioning to.
